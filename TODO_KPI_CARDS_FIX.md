b# KPI Cards UI Consistency Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue
The KPI cards (Total Target, Total Aktual, Progress, Outstanding) had `opacity-50` applied, making them look faded and different from other dashboard components.

## Solution Applied
- ✅ Removed `opacity-50` from KPI cards in `KPICards.tsx`
- ✅ All cards now have consistent styling with other dashboard components
- ✅ Cards maintain their gradient backgrounds and proper visual hierarchy

## Files Modified
- `frontend_posrekappenjualan/src/components/dashboard/KPICards.tsx`

## Result
All dashboard cards now have consistent opacity and visual appearance, matching the styling of NotificationsPanel, UnitPerformanceTable, and other dashboard components.

## Testing Recommendation
- Verify the visual consistency in the browser
- Check that all KPI cards now have the same opacity as other dashboard components
